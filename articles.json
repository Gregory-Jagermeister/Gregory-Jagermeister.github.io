            "content": "<p>To be completely honest I forgot I had this Blog Site set up... that was until I started this project and realised it would be excellent to record my journey with developing in Java</p><p>So have you ever played a Game of stardew Valley? Well currently me and my girlfriend have been addicted to the game. Building a farm that both enjoyable for use and pleasing to look at has been hella fun to do, however we realised that as our ambitions started to grow so did the difficulty of planning out our farm for the task.</p><p>Now already there is a very acceptable web app that does the job well, and that is <a href='https://stardew.info/planner/#'>The Stardew Valley Planner V2</a>, however you have to donate to use the multiplanner (in other terms pay to plan with others), which as a Uni student with every dollar going into life at the moment unfortunatly i'm a bit stingy about these things.</p><p>So i've decided to throw logic to the curb cause it would be cheaper to stretch my brain muscles. The Goal of this new project is to replicate the stardew valley planner in java while providing multiplanner functionality without having to spend a dime.</p><p>if by any chance Dear reader my project interests you (good job making your way to this blog site!!).. well at this current time I'm not opening this up to the public. The project itself is in a basic state (currently just a grid on a JFrame), so I want to get something that actually works before even considering releasing it to the public.</p>"
