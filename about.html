                        <p>Hi my name is Daniel, i'm a programmer, novice artist and video games enthusiast. Im a university student based in Australia, studying a Bachelor or IT majoring in games design and development. I started my development journey back in 2012 in year 9 (Australian education system), Since I was an avid video game player I would play various games and there stories captivated me. Not only did the stories told by the developer captivate me, the stories I made while playing these games caught me as well.
                        </p>



                        <p> It got to a point where I wanted to create my own worlds and ways to play. I started with Minecraft moding as it was popular at the time. I made small mods that werent published, just shared with friends, ultimatly decided that the java programming language was a wee bit advanced for what I understood.</p>
                        <p>Fast track to today and now I've learnt the fundamental basics to progamming, some advanced concepts and have experimented with a variety of programming languages, art styles and game engines. It brings me to this point where I want to record all my achievements, failures and methods to their resolutions. So Hence the Birth of the Dev Pot, The Website to record all of what i've discovered either from other people or my own experimentation.</p>
